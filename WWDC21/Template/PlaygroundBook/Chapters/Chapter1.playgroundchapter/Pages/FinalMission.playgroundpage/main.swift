 ## Chapter 3: Last Seen of Jerry
 
 You have finally got into the phone. It looks really clean, there are only three Apps...
 
 There are two possibilities:
 - 1. Jerry intentionally cleaned up his phone to reveal the clues
 - 2. Jerry does not use his phone a lot.
 
 Anyway, you wish he still left some information here. It should be easy to investigate.

 - Hint: The Task tracker will guide you throughout the game, it will be accessible anywhere in the phone. Either view the tracker in home screen, or tap on the Magnifying glass button on the bottom right corner in any App.
