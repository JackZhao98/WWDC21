 ## Chapter 1: The Lost Phone
 
 - Date: April 18, 2021
 
 Judy's husband Jerry was absent on her 33-rd birthday 6 days ago. Since then, no calls, no messages, nothing.
 
 The husband was reported missing later on April 12, however, no clues were found yet.
 
 The officer found this phone 3 hours ago, in the hotel room where the record says it was Jerry's last seen place.
 
 You are friend of Jerry, also a detective, and you think this phone could be the key to find the missing person. You wish to start investigating Jerry's missing from this phone, he must left it here on purpose.

 However, it seems like the device is currently locked with all data encrypted, and cracking the phone with force is \"very risky\" because it might potentially damage the disk.
